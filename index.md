# Molecular epidemiology through computational genomics

The Bhattacharya Lab for Computational Genomics is a team of researchers at [MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/)'s
[Department of Epidemiology](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/departments-divisions/epidemiology.html).
We explore the biological mechanisms contributing to cancer risk and outcomes and developmental phenotypes and develop fully open and accessible computational tools based on statistical principles to analyze large genetics, functional genomics, and clinical datasets.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We use statistical and epidemiological principles to develop and apply computational genomics tools to understand the biology underlying  cancer and development. We prioritize transparency, rigor, and reproducibility and value interdisciplinary collaboration and creativity.

Our goals are two-fold: (1) ask and answer important questions about cancer and development and (2) develop computational tools to help us explore these questions in large genetic and molecular datasets. Our software will always be open-source and our analyses reproducible.
