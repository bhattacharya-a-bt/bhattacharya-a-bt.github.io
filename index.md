# Molecular epidemiology through computational genomics

The Bhattacharya Lab for Computational Genomics is a team of researchers at [MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/)'s
[Department of Epidemiology](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/departments-divisions/epidemiology.html).
We explore the biological mechanisms contributing to cancer risk and outcomes and developmental phenotypes and develop fully open and accessible computational tools based on statistical principles to analyze large genetics, functional genomics, and clinical datasets.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We use statistical and epidemiological principles to develop and apply computational genomics tools to answer understand cancer and development. We prioritize transparency, rigor, and reproducibility and value interdisciplinary collaboration and creativity.

Our goals are two-fold: (1) develop computational tools to further genomics and (2) use these tools properly in large data to ask and answer important questions about cancer and development. Our software will always be open-source and our analyses reproducible.
