Taylor received her MSPH and PhD in Biostatistics from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Under the advisement of Michael Epstein, she focused her research on developing innovative statistical methods for investigating the genetic architecture of complex human traits. She is particularly interested in the application of these novel methods to better understand cancer risk. Outside of research, Taylor enjoys hiking, going to concerts, and playing tennis.
