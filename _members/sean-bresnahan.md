Sean received his PhD in Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative Biosciences from Penn State in 2024 for his research on phenotypic plasticity and intragenomic conflict in honey bees. He is broadly interested in developmental biology, transcriptomics and functional genomics, particularly at the maternal-offspring interface. Outside of the lab, he enjoys rock climbing, cooking, and woodworking. You can learn more about his work at (his personal website)[https://seantbresnahan.com/].
