Arjun is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Epidemiology](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/departments-divisions/epidemiology.html) at [MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/) and PI of the Bhattacharya Lab for Computational Genomics. The lab seeks to understand the biological mechanisms that contribute to cancer risk, progression, and outcomes and how genetics program human health during the developmental window. To achieve this, the lab develops fully open computational tools that integrate genetics and functional genomics datasets using statistical principles and machine learning methods. Before starting the Bhattacharya Lab in 2023, Arjun earned his Ph.D. in Biostatistics focusing on methods for genetics and transcriptomics in the context of breast cancer epidemiology from the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2020 with [Mike Love](https://mikelove.github.io/) and [Melissa Troester](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/melissa-troester-phd/). He then moved to the University of California, Los Angeles where he worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow until 2023 with [Bogdan Pasaniuc](https://bogdan.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/) and [Mike Gandal](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gandallab/). In his free time, Arjun likes to eat and cook, spend time outside, and cheer on his Tar Heels.
