We're an interdisciplinary group of epidemiologists, statisticians, geneticists, and computational biologists with the goal of 
developing computational tools to study the
genetic and molecular epidemiology of cancer risk/outcomes and developmental phenotypes. We value
collaboration, creativity, and civility.
